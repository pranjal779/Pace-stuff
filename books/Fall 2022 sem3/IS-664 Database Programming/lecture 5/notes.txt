/*
 The programming power of MySQL is limited when compared to other languages.
 MySQL language constructs are designed specifically to work with MySQL databases rather than as a 
general-purpose programming language.
 MySQL provided extensions to SQL known as stored programs. Stored programs can include 
procedural code that controls the flow of execution of a database operation.
 There are four types of stored programs:
 Stored Procedure
 Can be called from an application that has access to the database.
 Stored Function
 Can be called from a SQL statement.
 Trigger
 Is executed in response to an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement on a specific table.
 Event
 Is executed at a scheduled time.
